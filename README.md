**fm01** is a Discord bot built to replace and improve upon its predecessor, *FightMan01 bot*. It's a versatile bot
featuring moderation, utility, and fun commands.

## Running the Bot

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.12 or 3.13**
- **PostgreSQL**
- Recommended OS: **Linux** or **macOS** (for optimal compatibility with `uvloop`)
- The `uv` package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fm01-bot/bot.git
   cd bot
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root (follow the `.env.example` template)

3. **Create a `config.yml` file** following the structure of `config.yml.example`

4. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not running with docker), then:
    - Create a user named `lumin` with the password you defined above
    - Create a database named `lumin`, preferably owned by the `lumin` user
    - Optionally initialize tables by running the contents of `first_time.sql`

5. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```
   `uv run` will automatically set up the virtual environment for you and download required dependencies from
   pyproject.toml.

   If you want to run the bot in **debug mode**, change the `debug` value in `config.yml` to `true`.

## Using Docker

We've provided a Dockerfile and a compose file in the Github repo. You can simply run `docker compose up -d --build`
to start the bot in a Docker container. Make sure to follow until step 3, because the bot still needs
the `.env` and `config.yml` files to function properly.

## Contributor Notice

1. You're welcome to contribute via PRs - we’ll review and respond!

2. We're subclassing `commands.Context`. You’ll find this in `core/context.py`:
    - Import with `from core import Context`
    - This makes localization easier - check the docstring for details

3. The default language is **English**
    - New commands/features must include English-localized messages

4. Localization is handled via our custom package:  
   👉 [`discord-localization`](https://pypi.org/project/discord-localization)
    - Please check out our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/project-lumin) if you would like to add translations to
      the bot!

5. We use **NumPy-style docstrings**
    - All non-command functions should have docstrings, unless clearly self-explanatory (e.g., `load_cogs`)

6. **Helpers** are used for shared, reusable logic (e.g., `EconomyHelper` in `economy.py`)

7. For formatting, we use **custom argument classes** (e.g., `args.User`):
    - If you're adding a new argument class, please include a `from_X` classmethod (e.g., `User.from_user()`)
    - These help ensure editable messages are safe and intuitive (e.g., `User.avatar` returns the URL, not the raw
      asset)

8. AI contributions are allowed, but only if you're not vibe-coding things. We don't recommend opening pull requests without understanding how Python, discord.py or this project specifically works. An `AGENTS.md` file has been provided though.

9. Questions? DM **@pearoo** on Discord.

## Versioning & Releasing

Version numbers follow **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**:

- **MAJOR** → Breaking changes (e.g., full module overhauls)
    - Resets MINOR and PATCH to `0`
- **MINOR** → New features or updated command sets
    - Resets PATCH to `0`
- **PATCH** → Bugfixes, internal tweaks, or localization updates

> ⚠️ Version suffixes (e.g., `-beta`, `-dev`) will **not** be present in the live bot.
